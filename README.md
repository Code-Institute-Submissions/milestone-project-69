# Very Veggie - Milestone Project 1 

This project was created as the first of four milestone projects for Code Institute. 
The challenge was to create a static front-end cooking website. We needed to utilize the skills that were learnt in the first few modules, 
specifically HTML and CSS. This project was built as a recipe index for users wanting access to vegetarian and vegan recipes. The purpose
of the project was to provide recipes for users practicing a vegetarian and vegan diet as well as users wanting to explore vegetarian and 
vegan recipes. It was also built to inform users about a vegetarian and vegan diet. 
 
## UX
 
This website is for users practicing or exploring a vegetarian/vegan diet and users wanting access to vegetarian/vegan recipes. This website 
attempts to achieve that goal by providing navigation links in the navbar to finding out more about the website, proviiding access to a recipe 
index, and being able to subscribe to the website and recieve recipes via email. The footer contains links to various social media accounts, that
can be used to further explore.

## Testing

I validated my HTML and CSS code using the W3C validator. I had no errors or warnings to show. I examined my website in both
Chrome and Safari to check for cross brower compatibility. I used the responsive design mode in both browsers examining my site at 
various screen sizes. In both Chrome and Safari I viewed the site on the following devices:

- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5/SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 plus
- iPhone X
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- Laptop screen

I also filled out the contact form to ensure that it worked as it was supposed to. 
As well as this, I clicked on each link in my Navbar to make sure that I was taken to the relevant section. 

## Deployment

I deployed my website via GitHub pages. I also deployed the code locally in both Chrome and Safari.
